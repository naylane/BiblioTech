1) Actual stage:
   So, my pair and I are implementing the DAO method and making the classes.
   The Dao method is used to separate the logic of date access, it is basically
   a class that encapsulates how data is stored.

2) Project structure:
   Actually, we are a package model that is with the classes. The package Dao has
   the structure of the DAO method. The interface CRUD has the signatures of the
   main CRUD methods, and the class DAO is the entry point to access the DAO objects
   of the classes. So, we have packages of classes to apply the method DAO; each
   ackage has an interface and a class to implement the method crud.
